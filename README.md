# Predictive Analysis with big data techniques
Big data aims at managing an enormous volume of data at the highest possible speed taking into account the data variety. This document gathers the work carried out during the development of a software application for predictive analysis using big data techniques, showing the results through a Web application. It also describes the tools used in the development phase, implementation details, and concludes with a predictive analysis based linear regressions. The purpose of this work is to take a first contact with big data techniques and tools, Web technologies and the use of machine learning algorithms to make predictions.
